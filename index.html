    <h3>Germany BOP</h3>
    <p>My twelfth chart looks the Balance of Payments of Germany's trade in goods and services over the pandemic. In the discussion on Covid being a global event, the panel member who was discussing the impact of Covid in Europe stated that it had a more significant impact on trade of services (as they were more likely to require some in person interactions) than trade of goods. However, my graph below shows a dip in the value of trade of goods in and out of Germany, while services stay somewhat consistent over the first wave of Covid hitting (2020M3 to 2020M6). However, both see a sharp fall at some point within 2020M3 to 2020M8 and I believe the delay in services decreasing was simply a time lag.</p>
